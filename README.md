# EventorCasualSearch
Python script to get some details of casual orienteers (ie no club).

Orienteering Australia want to get a more concrete feel for orienteers who compete but don't join a club.

## Python Requirements
Any recent (as of 2020) version of Python 3 should work.

The requests module will need to be installed with pip if it is not in your Python environment already. It provides the very simple interface for doing GET requests that is used to retrieve Eventor data through the Eventor API.

*pip install requests*


## config.py
config.py isn't supplied in the gitlab repo, it is required and must be configured. See the samples folder for an example.
